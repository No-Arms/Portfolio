# Portfolio
Hi! My name is Noah Armsworthy, and this is my portfolio of personal project since graduating from University. 
My portfolio is where I aim to break open the black box of Machine Learning models and build them from scratch using basic Python libraries. 

This method is how I really learn to respect the complexity, or simplicity of effective models and solidify my comprehension of the components that make them.

Having always been a visual learning, these notebooks are also where I create visualizations along the way to help understand the moving parts, relationships and results.
