# Portfolio
Hi! My name is Noah Armsworthy, and this is my personal project since graduating from University with a Bachelor of Computer Science and a Certificate in Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems. 
This is where I aim to break open the black box of Machine Learning components and models by building and testing them, sometimes from scratch using basic Python libraries. 

This method is how I really learn to respect the complexity, or simplicity of effective models and solidify my comprehension of the components that make them.

Having always been a visual learning, these notebooks are also where I create visualizations along the way to help understand the moving parts, relationships and results.

## Completed
